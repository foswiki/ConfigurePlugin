---+!! Configure Plugin

%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

This plugin provides access to all Foswiki configuration data through
the webserver, supports running server-side checkers and wizards, and
allows you to save modifications.

You do not have to have this plugin installed to run Foswiki. Checkers
and wizards can be run from the command-line using the =tools/configure_test=
script, and !LocalSite.cfg can be manually edited to add your required settings.
However this UI provides a simple way to access the configuration.

If your system has an existing !LocalSite.cfg, then you *must* be
logged in to Foswiki as an administrator before attempting to use
this interface. If no !LocalSite.cfg exists, then you will automatically
treated as an admin for the purposes of =configure=.

Users of the =configure= interface access it through the CGI script in
=bin/configure=. The UI is self-explanatory and needs no further introduction
here.

Of interest to developers may be the JSON RPC interface provided by the
plugin, which gives access to the Foswiki configuration to web clients
(who must, of course, be authenticated as admins to make RPC calls).
